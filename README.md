### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FarmLink.git
   ```

   `Unzip the File`

2. **Open with VS Code**

   Open the project directory with VS Code or your preferred code editor.

3. **Install Dependencies**

    **Frontend:**

    - Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

    - Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables:

    ```env
    VITE_BACKEND_URL = your_backend_url (http://localhost:5000)
    ```

    - Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    - Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    **Backend:**

    - Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd api
    ```

    - Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables:

    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    JWT_EXPIRE =your_jwt_expiry (90d)
    ```

    - Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    - Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. **Update API URLs**

    Ensure that the API URLs in your frontend code are correctly pointing to your local backend server. Update the `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in the `.env` file (as mentioned in the previous step).

5. **Access the Application**

    After everything is set up:
    - Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the application.
    - Ensure the frontend loads correctly and communicates with the backend server.
